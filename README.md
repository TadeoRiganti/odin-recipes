TOP project #1 - HTML web recipe.

---

Hello there! 

This is my first HTML project from TOP curriculum and it's called "Recipes".
The idea is to practice all of the HTML knowledge I learned during the overall of the Foundations course and put it into practice:
Build a basic recpie website, in a "brutalist" web design fashion (so in the future I can do a CSS project to give it a more complex style.

Farewell!
