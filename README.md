TOP project #1 - HTML web recipe.



## -insert date-

Hello there! 

This is my first HTML project from TOP curriculum and it's called "Recipes".
The idea is to practice all of the HTML knowledge I learned during the overall of the Foundations course and put it into practice:
Build a basic recpie website, in a "brutalist" web design fashion so in the future I can do a CSS project to give it a more complex style.

I had this funny idea to tweak the excercise from "Odin recipes" to "Odin's recipes"... but the funniest part is that <mark>it took me more time to research about nordic mythology than building this website</mark>.
Either way, it helped me a lot to familiarize myself with the <strong>git workflow</strong>, since I got confused several times typing the names of the characters. <br>
Althought it's filled with some <strong>black comedy</strong>, I hope this project makes you smile a bit.

Thank you for reading!

I'm now working on the second assignement of the CSS Foundations.

More than one year has passed and now I know a bunch more things about how to develop and better skilled using GIT .. so, there will be a lot of refactoring. Not that anyone care about this, but oh boy! it would be easier to trash it and rebuild it from zero, but it's a good way to keep practicing my commits.

Althought the idea of the excercise is to do something random, just to test properties, I wanted to show off my new skills in CSS.
The idea for the design is super simple; style it like dusty scroll using a background image, maybe some gradient and multiplying the images.

Well, that's all folks!
