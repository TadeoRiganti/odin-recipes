        <h1>About this project</h1>

        <p>Hello there!</p>
        <p>This is my first HTML project from TOP curriculum and it's called "Odin recipes".
        The idea is to practice all of the HTML knowledge I learned during the overall of the Foundations course and put it into practice: Build a basic recipe website, in a "brutalist" web design fashion <em>(so in the future I can do a CSS project to give it a more complex style)</em>.</p>
        <p>I had this funny idea to tweak the excercise from "Odin recipes" to "Odin's recipes"... but the funniest part is that it took me more time to research about nordic mythology than building this website.
        <br>
        Either way, it helped me a lot to familiarize myself with the git workflow, since I got confused several times typing the names of the characters.</p>
        <p>Althought it's filled with some black comedy, I hope this project makes you smile a bit.</p>
        <p>Thank you for reading!</p></p>
