        <h3>Did you run out of Magic Mead rerserves?</h3>

        <p>
            Since mead was introduced in Valhalla, this drink revolutionized the world of the gods. However, it becomes increasingly scarce, mostly because of Odin, who drinks it all. Though it's really because there was only one Kvasir in existence. 
            But don't worry, Andhrímnir has a new recipe that promises to replicate its wonderful taste.
