        <h3>Mythical roasted boar on a tray</h3>

        <p>
            Amid the heroic songs of fallen skalds, these maidens brought the warriors vast quantities of meat from the cosmic boar Sæhrimnir, prepared by the cook of the gods Andhrimnir in his magical Eldhrimnir cauldron. Having finished the banquet, the boar's remains were gathered and brought back to life for a next meeting.
